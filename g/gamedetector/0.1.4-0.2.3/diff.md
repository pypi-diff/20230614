 # GameDetector
 
 Detect games, get Steam info, profit. This program allows you to select a folder on your system (probably in your game library), that contains a game. It looks in the game folder for files that can identify what game it is, get a Steam `AppId` for said game, and find a reasonable list of `EXE` files that could possibly be the game executable.
 
 The purpose of this application is so that it can be used in a much larger application, an automatic game manager for data hoarders. I'll let you know more about this as I develop it, but believe me, it'll be super rad.

 After executing the program, you will be prompted to select a folder (game folder). The program will then attempt to detect what game it is based on things like folder name, as well as checking known files that are commonly available in many distributions of games. It will tell you the name of the game detected, the version, the Steam AppId (if available on Steam), as well as a game description.
 
 This program isn't super useful to regular users, but it will be extremely handy to have as a library for other applications.
